Yes! Here are the essential **Time & Distance** formulas with explanations and tricks.  

---

### **1️⃣ Basic Formulas**  
📌 **Distance = Speed × Time**  
📌 **Speed = Distance / Time**  
📌 **Time = Distance / Speed**  

### **2️⃣ Unit Conversion**  
📌 **1 km/hr = 5/18 m/sec**  
📌 **1 m/sec = 18/5 km/hr**  

✍️ **Example:** Convert 72 km/hr to m/sec  
✅ \( 72 \times \frac{5}{18} = 20 \) m/sec

### **3️⃣ Relative Speed** (When two objects move towards or away from each other)  
📌 **When moving in the same direction:**  
✅ **Relative Speed = (Speed1 - Speed2)**  

📌 **When moving in opposite directions:**  
✅ **Relative Speed = (Speed1 + Speed2)**  

✍️ **Example:** Two trains moving in opposite directions at 50 km/hr and 30 km/hr  
✅ **Relative Speed = 50 + 30 = 80 km/hr**  

✍️ **Example:** Two cars moving in the same direction at 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr  
✅ **Relative Speed = 60 - 40 = 20 km/hr**

### **4️⃣ Average Speed**  
📌 **When speed changes over equal distances:**  
✅ **Average Speed = (2 × Speed1 × Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2)**  

✍️ **Example:** A car covers half the distance at 40 km/hr and the other half at 60 km/hr  
✅ **Average Speed = (2 × 40 × 60) / (40 + 60) = 48 km/hr**  

📌 **When speed changes over different time intervals:**  
✅ **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**

### **5️⃣ Train Problems**  
📌 **Train crosses a stationary object (pole, tree, signal, person, etc.):**  
✅ **Time = Train Length / Train Speed**  

📌 **Train crosses a platform or another train:**  
✅ **Time = (Length of Train + Length of Object) / Train Speed**  

✍️ **Example:** A 200m train crosses a 100m platform in 10 seconds. Find speed.  
✅ **Speed = (200+100) / 10 = 30 m/sec**  
✅ Convert to km/hr: **30 × 18/5 = 108 km/hr**

### **6️⃣ Boats & Streams**  
📌 **Upstream Speed (Against the flow):**  
✅ **Upstream Speed = (Boat Speed - Stream Speed)**  

📌 **Downstream Speed (With the flow):**  
✅ **Downstream Speed = (Boat Speed + Stream Speed)**  

📌 **Time Relation:**  
✅ **Time Taken Upstream > Time Taken Downstream**  

✍️ **Example:** A boat moves at 10 km/hr in still water, and the river’s speed is 2 km/hr.  
✅ **Upstream Speed = 10 - 2 = 8 km/hr**  
✅ **Downstream Speed = 10 + 2 = 12 km/hr**

### **7️⃣ Circular Tracks** (Two people running on a circular path)  
📌 **Same direction:**  
✅ **Time to Meet = Track Length / Relative Speed**  

📌 **Opposite direction:**  
✅ **Time to Meet = Track Length / (Speed1 + Speed2)**  

✍️ **Example:** Two runners on a 400m track at speeds of 10 m/s & 5 m/s  
✅ **Same direction:** Time = 400 / (10-5) = **80 sec**  
✅ **Opposite direction:** Time = 400 / (10+5) = **26.67 sec**

### **8️⃣ Shortcut Tricks**  
📌 **Speed Doubled → Time Halved**  
📌 **Speed Reduced to Half → Time Doubled**  
📌 **Objects moving at same speed → Distance ratio = Time ratio**
